#Dynamic Programming | Set 12 (Longest Palindromic Subsequence)#

Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it. For example, if the given sequence is “BBABCBCAB”, then the output should be 7 as “BABCBAB” is the longest palindromic subseuqnce in it. “BBBBB” and “BBCBB” are also palindromic subsequences of the given sequence, but not the longest ones.

Sample Input#1
```
BBABCBCAB
```
Sample Output#1
```
longest palindrome subsequence: BABCBAB
The maximum length of longest palindromic subsequence is 7
```
Sample Input#2
```
geeks for geeks
```
Sample Output# 2
```
longest palindrome subsequence: ee f ee
The maximum length of longest palindromic subsequence is 7
