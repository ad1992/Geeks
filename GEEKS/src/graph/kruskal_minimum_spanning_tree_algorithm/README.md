#Greedy Algorithms | Set 2 (Kruskalâ€™s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm)#

###Input Format###

First Line will contain N-The number of vertices and M-The number of edges.  
The next M lines will contain v1,v2,w where v1,v2 represent an edge and w represents weight between edges.  

###Output Format###
The tables consisting of edges in MST and the total weight of spanning tree.
